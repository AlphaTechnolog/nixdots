# Awesome Template

Just a starting template to make my own AwesomeWM rices.

## Features

- Helpers scripts that allows me to reuse scripts when making dashboards
- Helpers signals that implements an API to use the custom scripts when making dashboards
- A helpers file with a LOT of custom functions that (like the name says) helps me when ricing AwesomeWM.
- In the helpers, there is a function called transition that automates the process on animating colors transitions using `color` and `rubato`.
- the function add_hover implements an animated hover effect.
- My custom keybinds
- Wallpaper setup
- A lot more

## Features that aren't present from my dotfiles

- Custom notifications
- Helpers for notifications center

## Cloning

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth=1 https://github.com/AlphaTechnolog/awesome-template.git ~/.config/awesome
```

> Then just open awesomewm and you'll be able to use my keybinds.
